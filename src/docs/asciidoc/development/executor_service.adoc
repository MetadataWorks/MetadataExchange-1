= Working with Executor Service

When you want to execute asynchronous code you have to use https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/ExecutorService.html[ExecutorService]
provided by https://github.com/basejump/grails-executor[Grails Executor Plugin]. This brings some constraints for what can be run
inside the asynchronous task.

== Working with any entity
You cannot work with the entity reference directly, you have to store it's `id` and get it by that `id` inside the task closure

[source,groovy]
----
Long id = dataModel.getId()

executorService.submit {
    DataModel theDataModel = DataModel.get(id)
    // do something with data model
}
----

== Working with objects related to request and response
In similar way you have to store all the information from the `request`, `params`, `headers` or `response` needed
inside the task closure

----
String description = params.description
executorService.submit {
    // do something with description
}
----
